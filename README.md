# My Favorite Movies: **PERFUME**

## Overview
**Perfume** With his incredible talent for discerning scents, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is one of 18th-century France's finest perfumers. He becomes obsessed with capturing an elusive aroma: the scent of young womanhood. His search takes a deadly turn, and when the bodies of 12 young females are found, panic breaks out, with families rushing to lock up their daughters.

## Reason why i love this movie
- **The word perfume comes from the Latin word 'per fumum' which translates to 'through smoke.**
- **The world's first chemist and perfume maker was a woman named Tapputi.**
- **The same scent can smell different on two different people!**

## My Favorite Quote
> "A perfume is more than an extract, it is a presence."

## Main Idea of Perfume
Perfume is, at its heart, a novel about power. It explores how people obtain power, and then how they keep it or fail at doing so. A combination of religion and bureaucracy is introduced as the first avenue through which an individual can enjoy power.
